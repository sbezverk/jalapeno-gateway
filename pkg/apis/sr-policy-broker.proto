// SRv6 Sidecar on behalf of a client, requesting SR Policy from the broker providing:
// - Client's IPv4 or IPv6 address
// - Service's IPV4 or IPv6 address
// Both addresses are required because jalapeno-gateway might need to get SRH's segment list 
// between the service and the client.
// - Service's proto (TCP, UDP, Other, None)
// - Service's port (uint16, None)
// - Clinet's meta (new ipv6 extension header or some similar for additional client specific information)

// Types of policies:
// - SRH policy, defines cient's specific constraints which should be used in the computation of SRH segment list.
// - Encapsulation policy, where an outer header gets provided to the sidecar to encapsulate original packet.
// - Path Tracing header, if client's data packet must be decorated with a path tracing header.
// - Combination of SRH + PT or Encapsulation + PT

// TODO: define structure for each policy type.
